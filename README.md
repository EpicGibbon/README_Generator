# Node.js README Project
  ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-red)

## Description
This Project is all about simplifying the README file creation process. In this JavaScript application we use Inquirer and GenerateMarkdown to create such effortless files. Inquirer is being used to prompt various questions into the terminal field, whereas generateMarkdown then comes in and grabs these values and helps render them to the Readme file using template literals. This is the first version of this application.
